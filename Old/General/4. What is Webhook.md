# About
> Webhooks are user-defined HTTP callbacks.

> Webhook is a way for an app to provide other applications with real-time information.
A webhook delivers data to other applications as it happens, meaning you get data immediately. Unlike typical APIs where you would need to poll for data very frequently in order to get it real-time. 

> This makes webhooks much more efficient for both provider and consumer. The only drawback to webhooks is the difficulty of initially setting them up.

## Consuming a Webhook
> The first step in consuming a webhook is giving the webhook provider a URL to deliver requests to.

> This is most often done through a backend panel or an API. This means that you also need to set up a URL in your app thatâ€™s accessible from the public web

> The majority of webhooks will POST data to you in one of two ways: as JSON (typically) or XML (blech) to be interpreted
