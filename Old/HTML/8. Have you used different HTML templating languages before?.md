## Have you used different HTML templating languages before?

> No, but I hear about html template language like **PUG** which is HTML preprocessor this mean that it's basically a language that will be converted to native html code 

### Whay to use PUG
> Because bug is more cleaner to read also has a lot of extra features like loops, javascript objects and javascript logic, ...etc.
