### Trailing slashes
> Don't include XHTML-style trailing slashes for empty elements, as they are unnecessary and slow things down. They can also break old browsers if you are not careful (although from what we can recall, this hasn't been a problem since Netscape 4).

This is fine:

```html
<input type="text">
<hr>
```

The slashes are not needed:

```html
<input type="text" />
<hr />
```

### Use double quotes
> Use double quotes for HTML, not single quotes:

```html
<p class="important">Yes</p>
<p class='important'>Nope</p>
```
