It is an extension of Javascript. JSX includes both logic and markup. Unlike AngularJS, we do not require to create separate files for logic and markup.

```jsx
let element = <h1> This is JSX </h1>
```
Observe the above code carefully. It looks like HTML but also uses a javascript-like variable. This is JSX. In the above code, we are storing an HTML heading tag inside a variable. There are many advantages of using JSX.

- JSX is faster than Javascript.
- Logic and markup can be written inside the same file.
- It is easy to create templates in JSX.
- Let understand more about JSX with an example.
