The major features of React are:

○ It uses VirtualDOM instead RealDOM considering that RealDOM manipulations are expensive.

○ One-way Data Binding
> One-way data-binding means that through the whole application data flows only in one direction. This gives better control over it. The data is passed from the parent component to child component through read-only props.  Although, the child component can communicate with the parent component to update the state via callback functions.

○ Uses reusable/composable UI components to develop the view.

○ JSX
> Its syntax is very simple that makes writing components very easy 

○ Conditional rendering
> One of the best features of ReactJS is that we can use conditional statements inside the JSX. This helps a lot while displaying data in the browser according to the conditions.
