## Why is it generally a good idea to position CSS <link>s between <head></head> and JS <script>s just before </body>? Do you know any exceptions?

> Performance reasons. You want the CSS to be available as soon as possible to correctly display the site, and scripts in the head would block rendering while they're being loaded, so you want them to be requested after the rest of the document.
