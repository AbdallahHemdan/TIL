### Trailing slashes
> Use lowercase for all element names and attribute names/values, as it looks neater and means you can write markup faster:

This is good:

```html
<p class="nice">This looks nice and neat</p>
```

This is not so good:
```html
<P CLASS="WHOA-THERE">Why is my markup shouting?</P>
```
