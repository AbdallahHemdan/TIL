### What does a DOCTYPE do?

**DOCTYPE** is an abbreviation for **DOCument TYPE**. A DOCTYPE is always associated to a **DTD** - for **Document Type Definition**.

A DTD defines how documents of a certain type should be structured (i.e. a `button` can contain a `span` but not a `div`), whereas a DOCTYPE declares what DTD a document _supposedly_ respects (i.e. this document respects the HTML DTD).

For webpages, the DOCTYPE declaration is required. It is used to tell user agents what version of the HTML specifications your document respects. Once a user agent has recognized a correct DOCTYPE, it will trigger the **no-quirks mode** matching this DOCTYPE for reading the document. If a user agent doesn't recognize a correct DOCTYPE, it will trigger the **quirks mode**.

The DOCTYPE declaration for the HTML5 standards is `<!DOCTYPE html>`.

### How do you serve a page with content in multiple languages?

I will assume that it is asking about the most common case, which is how to serve a page with content available in multiple languages, but the content within the page should be displayed only in one consistent language.

When an HTTP request is made to a server, the requesting user agent usually sends information about language preferences, such as in the `Accept-Language` header. The server can then use this information to return a version of the document in the appropriate language if such an alternative is available. The returned HTML document should also declare the `lang` attribute in the `<html>` tag, such as `<html lang="en">...</html>`.

Of course this is useless for letting a search engine know that the same content is available in different languages, and so you must also make use of the `hreflang` attribute in the `<head>`. Eg. `<link rel="alternate" hreflang="de" href="http://de.example.com/page.html" />`

In the back end, the HTML markup will contain `i18n` placeholders and content for the specific language stored in YML or JSON formats. The server then dynamically generates the HTML page with content in that particular language, usually with the help of a back end framework.
