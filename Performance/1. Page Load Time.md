# Introduction
> Page load time is a key performance metric for any website to ensure a positive user experience,
it also influence a site’s search engine rankings.

## What is Page Load Time
> Web page load time begins when a site visitor first initiates a request and stops when the page’s entire content is displayed within their browser.

> In that time the following steps occur:
```
1. The visitor’s browser makes a request to your web server.
2. The server processes the request and sends a response back to the browser.
3. Upon receiving the requested page, the browser parses the code files (e.
```

## How we measure Page load time

1. Round-trip time (RTT)
> Measured in milliseconds, RTT is the duration from when a browser first sends out a request to when a response is returned.

    • Factors influencing RTT
      -----------------------
    1. physical distance between the visitor and server.
    2. server traffic volume.
    3. the number of intermediate nodes the request needs to pass through.

2. Time to first byte (TTFB)
> TTFB is the time taken for a browser to receive the first response byte from a server. 

> **Precise definition** of TTFB is the duration during which sufficient HTTP content loads before the browser can begin parsing it.

    • Factors influencing TTFB
      -----------------------
    1. network latency
    2. server load time 
    3. server processing time

### Effect of TTFB, RTT on SEO
> TTFB and RTT have been shown to be more prominent SEO ranking factors. Even a small reduction in TTFB can increase the chance a site will be found organically by potential visitors.
