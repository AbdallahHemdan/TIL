## What's the difference between "resetting" and "normalizing" CSS? Which would you choose, and why?

> Resetting overwrites the default browser behaviour (and usually sets everything to none or 0 ), while normalizing kind of 'evens it out' across browsers to make sure they all apply the same sensible defaults. I prefer normalizing.
