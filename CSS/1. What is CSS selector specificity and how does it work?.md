## What is CSS selector specificity and how does it work?

### About
> CSS Specificity is the set of the rules applied to CSS selectors in order to determine which style is applied to an element.

### CSS Specificity helps you to : 

1. It helps you understand why you styles aren't being applied.
2. It helps you organize your css code.
3. It helps you write cleaner and Less css code.

### How it works

> At a high-level, there are three buckets of specificity your CSS will fall under:

1. Type selectors & pesudo-elements
```css
// Type selectors
h1{}

// Pesudo-elements
::before{}
```

2. Class selectors & attibuite selectors & pesudo-classes
```css
// Class selectors
.cat { }

// Attibuite selectors
[type="radio"] { }

// Pesudo-classes
:hover { }
```
3. Id selectors
```css
// Id selector
#cat { }
```
