## Can you give an example of an @media property other than screen?

> Yes, there are four types of @media properties (including screen):

- all – for all media type devices 
- print – for printers
- speech – for screenreaders that “reads” the page out loud
- screen – for computer screens, tablets, smart-phones etc.

> Here is an example of print media type’s usage:

```css
@media print {
  body {
    color: black; 
  }
}
```
