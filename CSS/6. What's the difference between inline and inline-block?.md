## What's the difference between inline and inline-block?

> inline-block generally behaves like a block-level element, but does not force line breaks before or after

> Also **inline-block** helps us to create side by side boxes that collapse and wrap properly depending on the available space in the containing element.
It makes layouts that were previously accomplished with floats easier to create. No need to clear floats anymore.

> The major difference is that inline-block allows to set a width and height on the element.
Also, with display: inline, top and bottom margins & paddings are not respected, and with display: inline-block they are.
