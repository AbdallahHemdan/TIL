# What is Single Page Application

> Web apps that load a single html page and dynamically update that page as the user interact with the app

> A single-page application is an app that doesnâ€™t need to reload the page during its use and works within a browser.

> Think of the apps you use daily: Facebook, Google Maps, Gmail, Twitter, Google Drive, or even GitHub. All these are examples of a SPA.

> One of the best advantages of a correctly-configured SPA is the user experience (UX), where the user enjoys a natural environment of the app without having to wait for the page reloads and other things. You remain on the same page, which is powered by JavaScript programming language.
