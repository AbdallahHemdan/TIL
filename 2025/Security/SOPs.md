### **What Are SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures)?**  
**SOPs** are **step-by-step instructions** that define how to perform routine tasks correctly and consistently. They act as a "playbook" for teams to ensure:  
- **Consistency** (Everyone follows the same process).  
- **Compliance** (Meets legal/industry standards like ISO).  
- **Efficiency** (Reduces guesswork and errors).  
- **Safety/Security** (Minimizes risks, especially in IT/ops).

### **Examples of SOPs in a Frontend/IT Context**  
1. **Code Deployment SOP**  
   - Steps to test, build, and deploy frontend code (e.g., using CI/CD pipelines).  
   - Approval requirements (e.g., peer review before merging to `main`).  

2. **Incident Response SOP**  
   - What to do if a security breach occurs (e.g., log analysis, rollback process).  

3. **Security Patch SOP**  
   - How to apply critical updates to dependencies (e.g., npm packages).  

4. **Access Control SOP**  
   - How to grant/revoke system permissions (e.g., AWS, GitHub access).

### **Why Your ISO KPI Requires 85% SOP Adherence**  
- **Audits**: Proves to regulators (like ISO auditors) that your team works systematically.  
- **Risk Reduction**: Fewer mistakes in critical tasks (e.g., deploying untested code).  
- **Scalability**: New hires can follow documented steps instead of relying on tribal knowledge.

### **How to Ensure Compliance as a Frontend Engineer**  
1. **Check if SOPs exist** for your tasks (e.g., "Frontend Deployment Checklist").  
2. **Follow them strictly**—even small deviations count against the 85% target.  
3. **Document exceptions** (e.g., "Skipped QA test due to urgent hotfix—approved by CTO").  
4. **Suggest improvements** if SOPs are outdated or inefficient.
