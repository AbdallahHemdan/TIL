## Creating an array containing elements from 1 to n

> Some languages, such as Ruby, have a built in range constraint that makes it easy to construct an array of values from 1 to N. JavaScript is not one of those languages. Nevertheless, if you don't mind the aesthetics, you can get away with something like this:


### Solution 1

> In ES6 using Array [from](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/from) and [keys](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/keys) methods.

```javascript
let a = Array.from(Array(10).keys(), x => x + 1);
console.log(a);
```

### Solution 2

> Shorter version using [spread operator]().


```javascript
let b = [...Array.from(Array(10).keys(), x => x + 1)];
console.log(b);
```
