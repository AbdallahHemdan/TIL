## Explain how this works in JavaScript

- If the new keyword is used when calling the function, this inside the function is a brand new object.
- If apply, call, or bind are used to call/create a function, this inside the function is the object that is passed in as the argument.
- If a function is called as a method, such as obj.method() — this is the object that the function is a property of.
- If a function is invoked as a free function invocation, meaning it was invoked without any of the conditions present above, this is the global object. In a browser, it is the window object. If in strict mode ('use strict'), this will be undefined instead of the global object.
- If multiple of the above rules apply, the rule that is higher wins and will set the this value.
- If the function is an ES2015 arrow function, it ignores all the rules above and receives the this value of its surrounding scope at the time it is created.
