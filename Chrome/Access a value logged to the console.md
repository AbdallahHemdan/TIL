# Access A Value Logged To The Console

> Did your app just log an object to the dev tools console and you'd like to
interact with that object? It's not straightforward, but you can do it.

> Assuming you already have dev tools opened to the _console_ tab, right click
on the value that has been logged to the console. Select the _Store as
Global Variable_ option. This will re-log the value assigning it to the
`temp1` variable.

> You can now reference that object as `temp1` accessing its values and
calling functions.

> You can even do this with multiple logged values, each subsequent one will
be assigned incrementing variable names: `temp2`, `temp3`, etc.
