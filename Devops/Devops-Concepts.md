# Devops concepts
> List of common concepts in devops culture

## Introduction
> Devops = Development + Operation (We need someone who know about development and operation together)

## Software Life cycle
> the cycle of the development of certian product or application

1. Requirement Gathering 
2. System design 
3. Implementation
4. Testing 
5. Deployment
6. Maintenance


## Waterfall vs Agile

1. **Waterfall** is a `Liner Sequential` Life Cycle Model whereas **Agile** is a `continuous iteration` of development and testing in the software development process.
2. Agile allows changes in project development requirement whereas Waterfall has no scope of changing the requirements once the project development starts.

## Types of systems (Monolithic | SOA | MicroServices)

> In building the systems we have 3 option or 3 Software architecture design patterns either Monolithic, SOA or MicroServices

### Monolithic

> Client/Server applicatiion consists of **One tier**

### SOA (Service-Oriented-Architecture)

> In SOA, services are provided to the other components by the application components through a communication protocol over a network

> SOA is **_Share-as-much-as-Possible_** architecture pattern

### MicroServices

> In MicroServices, Complex applications consists of `small`, independent processes communicating using language agnostic APIs, these services are small and focus on doing a small task.

> MicroServices is **_Share-as-little-as-Possible_** architecture pattern, try to bound the context of each service
